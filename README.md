# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

The original purpose of this project was to analyze the test results of a school district's high schools upon several dimension - grade, school size, school budget, school type, etc. However, upon analyzing it was discovered that the 9th grade class of Thomas High School had commited academic dishonesty. The project then became to analyze the findings while omitting the data from the 9th grade class of Thomas High. 

## Results

There are several dimensions to look upon to see how the omission of the dishonest scores afected the overall data. We will go through these dimenssions one by one.

 ### Affect on District summary

   - The ommision of scores led to a .1 decrease in overall math scores across the district, no change in reading scores and .1 decrease in scores overall

    - The images show that ommitting the test scores of Thomas High School had significant affects on the ranking of Thomas high school in comparison to the other schools in          the district. The most stark affect is that Thomas High School's ranking dropped from 2nd in th district to 8th in the district.

     - Above are the math scores by grade before and after the ommision of the ninth grade scores. Ommitting these scores had no affects on the other grades' performances.

       - Above is the before and after for school spending. The results show significant decreases in the $630 - $644 bundle.

      - Above are the before and after in relation to school size. We can see a clear decrease in scores amound the middle sized group.

  ## Summary
  
  In conclusion, it is apparent that the ommision of the Thomas High School test scores had affects in every dimension studied in this analysis: for every dimension that group   of scores was a part of, a decrease was seen after the data cleanup. This academic dishonesty has unfortunately cost the district time and hopefully will not repeat itself in   the futute.
